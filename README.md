Bitcoin Chess

Five bankers (queens) guard the oracle (king) while 40 nodes (pawns) secure the Bitcoin network. Standard chess moves apply. The person playing as the Bitcoin network needs to take down the bank's server (king) and the bankers need to take out every node (pawns/plebs).# Bitcoin-Chess
