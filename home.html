            <h2>Fully Anticipated Queries</h2>
            <p>Q: What are the rules? <br/> A: It's standard chess rules with just a different setup and goal (for one team). All of the little bitcoins are pawns, the bankers are queens, and the bank's server is the king. The Bitcoin network wins when the server goes down and big bank wins when all nodes are captured.</p>
            <p>Q: Do you want banks to fail? <br/>A: Heavens no! That always means significant human suffering whether or not they get a bailout. However, this simulation demonstrates the difference between the safety provided by a bank or any other centralized institution (like a crypto exchange or the government) and a decentralized network like Bitcoin.</p>
            <p>Q: Got any other games? <br/> A: Yeah, check out <a href="https://national-debt-snake.vercel.app" target="_blank">National Debt Snake</a>or <a href="https://bitcoin-battleship.vercel.app" target="_blank">Bitcoin Battleship</a>.</p>
            <p>Q: Doesn't it actually only take a 51% attack to compromise the Bitcoin network? <br/> A: Sure, but more nodes (actually miners in the case of a 51% attack) are going to come back online in the event of a scenario like this. It would take a tremendous amount of unknown resources and energy to attempt to compromise what is now the most secure network the world has ever known. But yeah, the game is obviously meant to be satire. It's not a perfect analogy.</p>
